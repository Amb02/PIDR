(* Example of false attack 
   With unifyDerivation, the derivation is transformed into an infeasible
   derivation (it has attacker(a) as hypothesis).
   If, instead of allowing attacker(x) as hypothesis, we required
   to use clause (Rn) attacker(b[i]), then unifyDerivation would fail,
   showing that the derivation does not correspond to a trace.
